* What did I do today
- Created a properly validated CLI interface for record-linkage
- Reimplemented record linking logic to be extendible to arbitrary comparators, ie, compound fields and fuzzy matchers, if someone bothered implementing one.
* What will I do tomorrow
- Get my code reviewed
- Read about property-based testing
* Blockers
- I could not yet make a PR for the new linking logic, because I wanted my CLI merged and reviewed first. Then I can add options to support compounding fields.
* What I learned today (+ comments on the same)
- Hardly anything new, just some practice of writing Clojure.
- If it counts, I learnt how to use the CLI parsing library from clojure.tools
