* What did I do today
- Solve 4clojure problems: a couple mediums and two hards.
- Attended townhall
* What will I do tomorrow
- Solve a few more hard problems on 4clojure
- Read about non-trivial problems solved in clojurey ways (from Joy of Clojure)
  (since I did not do it today either). Opened the book, but felt like I'm not sure what I'm quite looking for. Will probably only check out the A* implementation for the time being.
* Blockers
- nah
* What I learned today (+ comments on the same)
- Nothing new. Sharpened up what I already know.
* Misc
- Solved more problems. I left comments above the solutions in the file, generally how I felt while solving a problem.
  Solutions can be found [[../4clojure.clj][here]].
