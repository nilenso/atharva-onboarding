** Catch-up with Kiran
Kiran verbally listed off several ways secrets are managed in projects he has seen. Some that I learnt about:
- Using an external application like Vault (by Hashicorp) or (more rudimentary) mozilla/sops.
- Barebones: dump the secrets in the server filesystem, either as a secret config file or =.env= file that is loaded into the environment on deployment.
- Use a SaaS with shiny UI to add secrets and call that to get the required config.
Bugle forms takes the second approach, because simplicity.
