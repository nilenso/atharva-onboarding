** Pairing with Dan
- Dan showed me the =spy= function from scope capture, which is this neat debugging tool that lets you capture all the locals accessible to an expression.
  - The functionality is somewhat overlapping with the CIDER debugger, but the advantage here is that I can run my program in a complete flow without breakpoints, and then observe these captured scopes afterwards.
- He also showed me how to observe Java classes and the methods exposed by them, which is a nice way of understanding what a library might be doing. "The code never lies": \
  ~(.getMethods (class library-thing)~
