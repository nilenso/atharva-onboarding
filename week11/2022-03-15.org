** Miscellanea about HTML forms
Some quirks that I didn't previously think of with HTML forms
- =name= is what becomes the key to access the input value in the form submission
- =id= is for the frontend, even if it semantically serves the same purpose
- Receiving form inputs as a dynamic list of submitted inputs is possible by adding a =[]= to the end of the =name= attribute. This is a non-standard thing, and a convention supported by frameworks. (Gotta check if Ring can let me do it.)
