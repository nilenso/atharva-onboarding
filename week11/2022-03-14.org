** Reviews
There were no logs for the last two days of last week because we had annual reviews. Even though I was not a part of this feedback, there was a lot to learn by simply observing the feedback other people gave and got. I feel like I got a taste of the challenges that I might face later in my career.
** Office IRL
Today most of us are working in the same physical office. It feels nice to be around humans. I feel like I might absorb a lot of subtle things just by being more around nilenso folks.
