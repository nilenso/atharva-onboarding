* TIL + YIL (+ commentary)
** Pairing with Udit (yesterday)
- I learnt about good practices when setting up a database, which I'd summarize as:
  - Make your database setup easily reproducible by other developers—we did this using docker-compose and migrations (using migratus)
  - Have clearly separated configuration profiles—we used aero to make this seamless
- Learnt misc things about connecting to a database in the Clojure ecosystem, eg, jdbc and use of db specs.
** Catch-up with Prabhanshu
- He gave me hints about how to approach user authentication—sessions is not the only way. \
  My task will now be to figure what is the most suitable way to authenticate for our use case.
