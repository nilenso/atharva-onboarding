* What did I do today
- Delivered a minimum working artifact for record linkage
- Wrote clojure tests for the first time
* What will I do tomorrow
- Start (and if time permits, finish) working on a more generic record linker
- Read about property-based testing
* Blockers
- nah
* What I learned today (+ comments on the same)
** Pairing session with Govind
- Tradeoffs between handwritten unit tests and property-based generative tests
  - Handwritten unit tests: easy to write, better conveys intent of program, but you can't account for most cases
  - Generative tests: less easy to reason about properties, generator has to be designed generate data in ways that are useful to the program, can't be totally random
- A nice way of organizing code is to have the messy side effects at the boundaries, while keeping the core purely functional.
  - Generalization: onion architecture
** Catch-up with Kiran + Prabhanshu
- Discussions on testing style and readability (and the TDD word)
- Arrange, act, assert
