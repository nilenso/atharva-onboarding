** A note about generating random numbers in Clojure
There isn't a great Clojure library that provides a proper CSPRNG function, which was surprising. The only okay one I found was [[https://funcool.github.io/buddy-core/latest/00-introduction.html][buddy/buddy-core]] which says on the documentation's front page that the API might break...

The nice thing is that I can just use Java's interop. Since I only need a CSPRNG this lets me have it without needing any extra dependencies:
#+begin_src clojure
(defn generate-session-id
  []
  (let [random (SecureRandom.)
        base64 (.withoutPadding (Base64/getUrlEncoder))
        buffer (byte-array 32)]
    (.nextBytes random buffer)
    (.encodeToString base64 buffer)))
#+end_src
