In today's episode of overloaded words:
- collection: sets, vecs, lists, maps (but not string)
- seq: API that requires implementation of ~first~ and ~rest~
  - works on all collections and strings
  - BUT
  - ~seq?~ returns true only on ~lists~. Â¿?
    - this is because a ~first~ and other seq functions first convert the collection to a seq and then do the ~first~ operation on it.
- sequential: vecs and lists, but nothing else (ie, data that has an ordering)
- sequence: a sequential collection that may or may not be realized yet
